# automatic-COVID-19-detection
In this project, a new model for automatic COVID-19 detection using raw chest CT- scan images is presented. The model is developed to provide accurate diagnostics for binary classification (COVID vs. No-Findings) and multi-class classification (COVID vs. No- Findings vs. Pneumonia).
